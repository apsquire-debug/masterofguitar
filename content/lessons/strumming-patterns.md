# Essential Strumming Patterns

Strumming is what brings chords to life! Let's learn patterns that will work with almost any song.

## What You'll Learn

- Basic down-strum patterns
- Down-up strumming combinations
- Rhythm and timing
- Adding dynamics to your playing

## Pattern 1: All Downs

The simplest pattern - all downstrokes on each beat:
```
DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN
1    2    3    4
```

Use this for slower songs or when you want a strong, driving rhythm.

## Pattern 2: Down-Up

Add upstrokes between the beats:
```
DOWN  up  DOWN  up  DOWN  up  DOWN  up
1    and  2    and  3    and  4    and
```

This creates movement and energy in your playing.

## Pattern 3: The Folk Pattern

A classic pattern used in countless songs:
```
DOWN  DOWN  up  up  DOWN  up
1     2     and and  4    and
```

Practice this slowly with a metronome until it feels natural.

## Tips for Better Strumming

1. **Keep Your Arm Moving**: Even when not strumming, maintain the motion
2. **Relax Your Wrist**: Let your wrist do the work, not your whole arm
3. **Start Slow**: Master the pattern at 60 BPM before speeding up
4. **Use Dynamics**: Vary your volume for more musical playing

## Practice Exercise

Play through these chords with Pattern 2:
- G (4 measures)
- D (4 measures)
- Em (4 measures)

Repeat this loop until the transitions feel smooth.
